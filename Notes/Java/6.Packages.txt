PACKAGES:

Packages are group of related classes.
Classes inside the packages can access each others package-access members

2. Programmers know where to find files of similar types
3. The names wont conflict
4. You can have define access of the types within the package

Naming convention:
-------------------
1. Only lower cases for all letters
2. company uses reverse domain name as package name --> Domain name - google.com -- Packages are com.google.homepage or com.google.loginpage
